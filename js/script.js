		" stalks parted where he stepped and he ran through the fields, and played in the stalks because he liked the way"+
		" the field smelled. As he ran into the forest he saw a great tree. A tree taller than the tallest building in his"+
		" whole town. It was close to being so tall he couldn't even see the top of it. And he sat at its roots, where he"+
		" realized that he was tired and soundly fell asleep. </p><p>He awoke to the sounds of the forest trees swaying,"+
		" and the sounds of the cicadas chirping, and the sky had already turned dark. A great gust of wind suddenly blew"+
		" him off his feet, and he heard a great \"Hoo...\" The Great Owl was perched on a branch and staring down at him"+
		" with its great big eyes. \"Hello\" it said. \"I am the Great Owl.\" The boy looked back into its great brown"+
		" eyes as other woodland animals began to gather to see who had arrived. \"My name is Jason,\" the boy said."+
		" \"There has never been a human in this forest before,\" the Great Owl said. \"What does a human doooo?\""+

		" There I was, being born. I was a baby you see, right out of my moms womb. The doctor delivered me at the"+
		" stroke of midnight. Out I came, a little moist and wearing my nicest suit and coat. They called me Jann,"+
		" Private eye. The doctor was smoking a cigar and asked me to look into a death that had occurred in the hospital"+
		" the day previous. It was supposed to be an open and close case. A woman, age 30 was murdered in her hospital bed."+
		" Murder weapon was a kitchen knife, later the knife was found in a nurses' locker. Her uniform had he victims"+
		" blood on it too. So. Sharon B. Applebee, 42 years old, nurse for 20 years, decides to murder one of the hospital"+
		" patients with absolutely no ties. Well, we have her fingerprints on the stuff. So anyways like I was saying it"+
		" was open and closed, and so we locked her up and she was convicted. Anyways, it's been 5 years and I get in"+
		" this bike accident you see. I'm riding my tricycle and my dad backs up into me on the driveway and I break"+
		" my foot. So there I am on the white table again, and the doctor mentions that one of their patients was injured"+
		" a few weeks ago. Patient survived the attack, but ended up in a coma. Hearing it didn't really put any pieces"+
		" together, the old case seemed wildly unrelated. After I got my cast, I said I needed to use the facilities and"+
		" took a breather. I asked some of the staff what they remembered about the event and they told me to mind my own"+
		" business. So, I did and I just walked back to the exam room. Probably that spring I retired from the detective"+
		" business, and yeah there really wasn't anything wrong with my first deduction- later I heard that Sharon"+
		" Applebee confessed to the crime in the slammer, so I was right the first time. Anyway, that's what happened"+
		" back in '94, it was my debut case and it helped me climb the ladder to where I am today. So now you know."+
